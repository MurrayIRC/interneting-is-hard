        <h1>interneting is easy, yo</h1>
        <p>first, we gotta learn da basics</p>

        <h2>headings</h2>
        <p>headings define the outline of ur site. there are six levels of headings.</p>
        
        <h2>lists</h2>
        <p>this is how you make an unordered list</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>they don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

        <p>this is what an ordered list looks like</p>
        <ol>
            <li>notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>but, the list item elements are the same</li>
            <li>also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
            <li>you should be niticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>inline elements</h2>
        <p><em>sometimes,</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase</p>
        <p>other times, you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>
        <p><em><strong>and sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

        <h2>empty elements</h2>
        <p>thanks! inteneting should be getting easier now.</p>
        <p>regards, <br/>the authors</p>
